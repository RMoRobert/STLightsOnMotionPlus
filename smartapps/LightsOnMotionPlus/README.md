# STLightsOnMotionPlus
SmartThings "Lights on Motion Plus" app, intended to recreate and add additional featueres (e.g., remembering on/off states for a group of lights when motion stops and restoring it when motion resumes, rather than turning all back on) compared to stock light/motion app.

As of 2018, **this project is no longer maintained**. My primary home automation system is now Hubitat, and I have forked this project for that platform and maintain its development here: https://github.com/RMoRobert/Hubitat/tree/master/apps/LightsOnMotionPlus
